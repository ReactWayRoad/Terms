### Framework vs Library  

The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control".   
You tell libraries what to do, frameworks tell you what to do.  
A library is a collection of prewritten code that can be used to simplify tasks(classes, functions  
A framework is a structure in which the application defines the content of the operation by asking the developer to fill in the spaces.
